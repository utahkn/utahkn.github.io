title: Good Luck on Exams and Happy Holidays!
---

As this semester comes to an end, HKN would like to wish everyone the best of luck on their upcoming exams.

We want you to know that the IEEE room (NH 132) will likely be open throughout the week, and ALL are welcome to come and study here. 
It is a great place to collaborate with classmates and possibly get help from upperclassmen.



Study smart!
